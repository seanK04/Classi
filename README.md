# 🎓 Classi: Reinventing Course Reviews  

## 💡 Inspiration  
A few weeks ago, one of our team members, **Sean**, downloaded an app called **Beli**, a restaurant ranking platform that uses **pairwise comparisons** instead of static ratings. Despite never being a restaurant reviewer, he found himself ranking nearly **200 restaurants** in just a few days.  

Why? Because Beli makes the process **interactive, social, and fun**.  

This sparked an idea—what if we applied this same concept to **course reviews**?  

🚨 **Problem:**  
Traditional course review platforms suffer from **low engagement**, leaving many courses without sufficient reviews. As a result, students are forced to **guess** when selecting their classes.  

✨ **Our Solution:**  
By making ranking as **engaging and game-like** as Beli, we can **incentivize students to participate more**, leading to **richer, more complete data** that benefits everyone.
